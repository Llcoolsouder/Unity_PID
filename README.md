# Unity_PID: Ball and Beam Control System

This is our final project for Systems and Controls at Rowan University.  We chose to implement a PID controller to balance a ball on a target location on a beam in Unity3D.  
This demo can be played by downloading the files in this repo and opening **SnC_PID.exe**, or you may open the top level folder in Unity to modify and/or build the project.  
The target platform for this demo is Windows 10. This has not been tested for any other platforms.

## Player Controls
Move Target Marker - Left and Right arrow keys  
Add Random Force to the Ball - Space bar
